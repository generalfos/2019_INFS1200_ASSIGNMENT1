Assignment Brief:

The following describes the Universe of Discourse for the assignment:
Housing websites have increased in popularity and are now one of the main ways
people find places to live. In this assignment we will model a system similar to
realestate.com.au or domain.com.au.

The system is required to store information on properties including their address
(number, street, suburb, state etc), and a number of property features. Typically,
there are either stand-alone properties e.g. houses, or properties that consist of
multiple units e.g. apartments or townhouses. An apartment or townhouse will be
identified by a number within the property (eg. Unit 1, 24 Main St). All properties will
be described by a number of features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms,
car parks and other features where relevant.

Real estate agencies are responsible for managing the sales and rentals of properties.
Each agency must apply for an agency license and may have a number of branches. An
agency will only have one branch in any given suburb and should have its contact
details available.

Real-estate agents are responsible for managing individual properties. Each agent has
a license number as well as personal information recorded. Agents list houses or
individual town houses/apartments for sale or rental and the system must be able to
track the sale and rental history of any listing. An agent works for one real estate
agency at a time but are known to move between agencies from time to time.

Once a listing is made the agent may set up open houses to allow customers to view
the property before applying for purchase or rental. The proposed system does not
store any information on property sellers, buyers or tenants.
Based on the above UoD, you are required to undertake the following design tasks
and then document them in the provided template.
